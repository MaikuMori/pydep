# TODO(a placeholder for tests):
# - requirements.txt present
# - no requirements.txt present, setup.py present
# - no requirements.txt or setup.py - graceful failure
# - setup.py executes in a """if __name__ == '__main__':""" clause (prefer runpy.run_path over import)
# - requirement doesn't have setup.py - best effort with warning
# - requirement setup.py reads relative file path (see package 'invoke')
